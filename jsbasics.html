                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting 
                    language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety 
                    of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language 
                    allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in 
                    a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside 
                    a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it 
                    can be connected to the objects of these environments to 
                    provide programmatic control over them.

                        <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript 
                        variables are containers for storing data values 
                        - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds 
                        the coffee, a variable holds the value. All 
                        JavaScript variables must be identified with unique
                         names. These unique names are called identifiers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment 
                        operators assign valuse to JavaScript variables - our
                         cup can now have coffee poured into it, giving our 
                         variable a value to hold. the = assignment 
                         operator assigns a value to a variable. 
                         <span>var x = 10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an 
                        important concept; to be able to operate on 
                        variables you need to know the data type. There are
                        six data types that are JavaScript primitives: 
                        Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> 
                        null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - 
                        <span>42</span> or <span>3.15159;</span> String - 
                        <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>
                        [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - 
                        <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Conditionals</a> Whenm you write code,
                        you want to perform different actions for different
                        decisions - hitting different code blocks based on 
                        values or conditions that have been met. You can 
                        use conditional statements in your code to 
                        accomplish this. There are the following conditional
                        statements: <span>if</span> a specified conditional
                        is true, do this code in our code block; <span>
                        else if</span> to specify a new condition to test,
                        if the first condition is false; <span>else</span>
                        we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Loops</a> There are many kinds of loops
                        in every programming language, but they all 
                        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an 
                        action some number of times. Imagine you have to 
                        run a mile, well you can run around the track
                        four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an 
                        encapsulation of a code block. When we call our
                        function this will run that code block. Think of
                        it as a list of instructions. As an example 
                        imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, 
                        we open up the instruction manual and get started, 
                        first we screw the legs to the table top; next we 
                        place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
                        our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables 
                        to do so let's call our function over and over and 
                        over again.
